# BLEServiceDiscovery

## Getting started
This is a non-expo setup, if you're having problems be sure to follow the [React Native CLI instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

Install the dependencies:
```
npm i
```

For ios, install cocoapods:
```
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

Run Metro in the root of the project:
```
npx react-native start
```

Then, in a new tab run:
```
npx react-native run-ios
```
